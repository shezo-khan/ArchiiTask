Description:

I have used Vue-Cli. For Such kind of Tasks its more quicker to set up the environment.

The task might not fullfill all the requirement but within the due timeframe i did my best. (I might be wrong completely).

Stack:
Webpack (My fav JS IDE)
Vue-Cli (for a Quick up and runnung)
Single file component (As everyone should be using)
